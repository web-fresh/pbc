# Webfresh: Palm Business Center

Palm Business Center is a general purpose business store located in Palm, PA. Thier current website was 15+ years old, and in dire need of a revamp. Most notably there was a need to create a modern, responsive design. This theme accomplishes that goal, and more, by building on the Wordpress CMS, along with a modern CSS/JS workflow and Twig templates via the Timber plugin.

## Required Wordpress Plugins

- Timber

## Development Dependencies

- Node/Npm
- Yarn

## Workflow

- Edit Twig templates in the `views` directory.
- Edit JS/CSS in the /src directory. 
- Run `yarn assets:build` to compile your changes. 
- You may alternatively run `yarn assets:watch` if you wish to watch the assets files for changes.
